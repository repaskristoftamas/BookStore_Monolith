# Full-Stack Framework Learning Project

## 🎯 Goal  
This project is focused on learning **Angular, React, and Vue.js** from scratch by implementing the same frontend using all three frameworks.  
The first I'm working with is **Angular**.  
This is a **very work in progress** repository and may contain unintentional mistakes, temporary comments or bad practices or maybe it will not build at some points in the future.

## 🤷 Why?  
No real reason—just for fun and learning!

## 🏗️ Tech Stack  
- **Backend**: ASP.NET Core Web API
- **Frontend**: Angular | React | Vue.js

## 🚀 Future Plans
This repository will be built in a **monolithic architecture** and later on it will have a **microservices-based sibling** with the most preferred framework, where additional features like **payment systems, shopping cart, and more** will be introduced.
